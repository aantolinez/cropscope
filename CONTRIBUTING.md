# 🤝 Contributing to CropScope

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CropScope** — an open-source, metadata-driven software suite for reproducible computer vision datasets.  
At this stage, contributions are welcomed **for major feature proposals, external collaborations, or integration with related projects**, but **direct commits to the central repository are temporarily restricted**.

---

## 📘 Contribution Policy

To ensure code quality, reproducibility, and architectural consistency, **all proposed changes must first be reviewed** before integration.  
We currently do **not** accept direct commits or pull requests to the main branch.

However, we **encourage collaboration** through the following pathways:

### 1. 💡 Feature Proposals
Researchers and developers may submit **proposals for new modules or major features**, including (but not limited to):
- Integration with external AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
- Extensions to new imaging formats or metadata schemas
- Advanced visualization, deduplication, or validation modules
- Cloud connector support beyond S3-compatible systems

Each proposal should include:
- A short description (max. 300 words)
- Intended scope and expected impact
- Dependencies or external systems involved
- Preliminary implementation plan (if applicable)

Please send proposals by email to:  
📧 **aantolinez@yahoo.com**

### 2. 🤝 External Collaborations
We welcome collaborations with:
- Research groups working on data-centric AI or imaging datasets  
- Academic and industry teams interested in integrating CropScope into their pipelines  
- Developers building cloud or metadata management tools for scientific reproducibility  

Collaborative development agreements or integrations will be coordinated through private forks or sandbox repositories until review and approval.

---

### 3. 🧩 Integration with External Projects
If you are developing a project that could benefit from or extend CropScope (e.g., dataset hosting, annotation platforms, AI pipelines), please reach out before integration to ensure:
- Interface and licensing compatibility  
- Consistent metadata structures  
- Sustainable code maintenance practices

## ⚙️ Development Guidelines (for approved collaborators)

For those granted repository access after review:
- Use feature branches and meaningful commit messages.
- Follow Java 1.8+ and Maven/Gradle project structure conventions.
- Provide complete JavaDoc and configuration documentation.
- Submit all changes via **reviewed pull requests**.
